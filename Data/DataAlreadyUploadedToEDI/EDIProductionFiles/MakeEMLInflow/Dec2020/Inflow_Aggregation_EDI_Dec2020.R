# Title: Prepare FCR inflow data for publication to EDI
# Author: Mary Lofton
# Date 18DEC18

# Updated: 17Dec19 by R. Corrigan and A. Hounshell
#   Added script to incorporate Diana (VT) data for publication
#   Updated flags for v-notch weir

# Updated: 07Feb20 by A. Hounshell to included WVWA data through 31 Jan 2020

# Updated: 20Feb20 by A. Hounshell - not correctly flagging low-flow data for the v-notch weir; as of 07 Jun 2019, 
# pressure sensors should be at the same location as the bottom of the weir

# Updated: 06Mar20 by A. Hounshell - updated V-notch weir calculations with rating curve calculated from correlations
# between gage height and pressure for the WVWA and VT pressure sensor from 7 Jun 2019 to present. Updates to this
# relationship will be needed for 2020 EDI push. Relationships is documnted in EDI metadata and with associated data
# file with data for the gage height vs. pressure relationships. The gage relationship updates when the weir is 
# too low/over-topped for the period AFTER 6 Junn 2019. Nothing was changed for data prior to 6 Jun 2019.
