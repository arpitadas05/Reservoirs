Ice cover was recorded at Falling Creek Reservoir (Vinton, Virginia, USA) using multiple methods in 2013-2019. Falling Creek Reservoir is owned and operated by the Western Virginia Water Authority as a primary drinking water source for Roanoke, Virginia, and is one of the southernmost waterbodies in the United States that exhibits ice cover during the winter. Given incipient climate change, Falling Creek Reservoir's ice cover data represents an important record of warming for waterbodies in the southeastern United States. Ice cover presence was assessed using multiple methods: visual observation of ice spanning the deep hole (from an observer standing on the reservoir's dam); water temperature data from sensors deployed at the reservoir's deepest site; and upwelling shortwave radiation from a meteorological station deployed on a metal structure that is located over the reservoir's deep hole.
